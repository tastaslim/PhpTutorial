<ul>
  <li>mysqli extension</li>

  <h3>mysqli extension:</h3>
  We should use it when we arepretty much sure that we are not going to switch to other databases or we are sure that our application needs only
  mysql databse. If we are sure we must use it.
</p>

<p>
  <h3>PDO(Php datatbase object):</h3>
  We should use it when we are not sure whether our application needs more than one type of databases. PDO written codes can be used with any database but in comparision to mysql it is hard to manage.
